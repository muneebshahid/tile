"""Agent run events and provider stream callable contracts.

Run lifecycle contract: every run log begins with ``RunStartEvent`` and
ends with exactly one ``RunEndEvent`` committing the terminal outcome,
for every in-process termination path. Only those two events are
guaranteed. The inner events are producer-emitted and nest as
``run ⊃ agent attempt ⊃ turn ⊃ message / tool executions``; a failure or
abort can tear a run down with inner scopes still open, so an inner start
may lack its end. Consumers apply one sweep rule: an end event ends
anything still open inside its scope, and ``RunEndEvent`` ends everything
— its outcome names why, exactly once. Provider stream fragments (text,
reasoning, and tool-call start/delta/end updates carried by
``MessageUpdateEvent``) are message content, not lifecycle scopes: the
containing message's end, or the sweep, terminates their outstanding
state. Hard process death is outside this contract — no process can
publish an event after it has stopped.
