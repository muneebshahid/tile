"""Prompt programs: what a prompt run emits and how it concludes.

Execution pushes inner events through the run's publish callable and
returns the ``RunOutcome``. It never publishes run lifecycle events and
never touches the run store: the run turns the returned outcome — or the
exception or cancellation that replaces it — into the terminal run end
event, so a duplicated or missing run end is unrepresentable here.
